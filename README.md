# Exo-Arm
An Open Source project to help people with less strength in arms and hands

Work in progress!

Corrected some geometry in the right hand base and also added a left hand base!

All 3D STL files are scaled properly now!

I have added 3D printable snap lock pins for the Exo Hand, if you wish to use instead of the screw bolts and nuts! See in the link below! Thank you!

Please see the images for reference for assembly of the project!
